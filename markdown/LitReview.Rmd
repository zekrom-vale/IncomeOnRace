y=f(x) is a common expression of the idea that a given output is a function of all the inputs. This is a deceiving simple concept but an important one that has made research into the wage gap difficult. There are numerous published articles that try to pinpoint the reason a wage gap exists amongst multiple diversity categories. So many in fact that some factor-combinations yield no gap. Take for example, the May 2006 work published by Dan Black.

> *We find that these wage differences generally appear to be the consequence of differences in premarket factors: age, the levels and types of education, and English fluency and/or assimilation. In particular, among college-educated men who speak English at home, our estimated wage gaps are very close to 0 for Hispanic and Asian men. Similarly, the unexplained wage gap is approximately 0 for black men with college-educated parents not born in the South. We provide fragmentary evidence that the unexplained gap for other black men - Southern-born men and those born elsewhere to poorly educated parents - is related to the generally poor quality of education afforded these men at the precollege and college levels.*

Which is in direct contrast to a Matt Huffman's 2004 work where he found evidence of increasing tendencies toward racial discrimination as the job stakes are raised (high-status jobs).

The majority of published works we reviewed found evidence to support the claim that a wage gap exists between underrepresented populations and the dominate population. Studies ranged from scopes as broad as the work of Oliver and Shapiro in 2006 that looked at total debt-to-asset ratios to scopes as narrow as the work of Broyles and Fenner looking specifically at the field of STEM. What it comes down to is that while there is a lot of information published, there are not many works reproducing or confirming those results. We set out to find the answer ourselves. We found that despite all the disparate studies, the overwhelming find is the gap exists. Our findings also confirm this.
